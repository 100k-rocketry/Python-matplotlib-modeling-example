# Python-matplotlib-modeling-example

This is a small python program that generates coordinates from a 3d function and models the coordinates on a 3d graph using matplotlib.
The program writes the coordinates into a text file and reads the coordinates into an array. I did this because
it may be easier this way when we try modeling in real time. Matplotlib has a options to create much prettier modeling than what I have
done, and I believe it has functionality to model in real time.

This program is just an idea, I don't expect it to be used in any way unless you guys like it.
